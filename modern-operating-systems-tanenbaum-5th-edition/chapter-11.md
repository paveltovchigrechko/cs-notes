1. Give one advantage and one disadvantage of the registry vs. having individual .ini files.

2. A mouse can have one, two, or three buttons. All three types are in use. Does the HAL hide this difference from the rest of the operating system? Why or why not?

3. The HAL keeps track of time starting in the year 1601. Give an example of an application where this feature is useful.

4. In Sec. 11.3.3 we described the problems caused by multithreaded applications closing handles in one thread while still using them in another. One possibility for fixing this would be to insert a sequence field. How could this help? What changes to the system would be required?

5. Many components of the executive (Fig. 11-11) call other components of the executive. Give three examples of one component calling another one, but use (six) different components in all.

6. Win32 does not have signals. If they were to be introduced, they could be per process, per thread, both, or neither. Make a proposal and explain why it is a good idea.

7. An alternative to using DLLs is to statically link each program with precisely those library procedures it actually calls, no more and no less. If this scheme were to be introduced, would it make more sense on client machines or on server machines?

8. The discussion of Windows User-Mode Scheduling mentioned that user-mode and kernel-mode threads had different stacks. What are some reasons why separate stacks are needed?

9. Windows uses 2-MB large pages because it improves the effectiveness of the TLB, which can have a profound impact on performance. Why is this? Why are 2-MB large pages not used all the time?

10. Is there any limit on the number of different operations that can be defined on an executive object? If so, where does this limit come from? If not, why not?

11. The Win32 API call WaitForMultipleObjects allows a thread to block on a set of synchronization objects whose handles are passed as parameters. As soon as any one of them is signaled, the calling thread is released. Is it possible to have the set of synchronization objects include two semaphores, one mutex, and one critical section? Why or why not? (Hint: This is not a trick question but it does require some careful thought.)

12. When initializing a global variable in a multithreaded program, a common programming error is to allow a race condition where the variable can be initialized twice. Why could this be a problem? Windows provides the InitOnceExecuteOnce API to prevent such races. How might it be implemented?

13. Name three reasons why a desktop process might be terminated. What additional reason might cause a process running a modern application to be terminated?

14. Modern applications must save their state to disk every time the user switches away from the application. This seems inefficient, as users may switch back to an application many times and the application simply resumes running. Why does the operating system require applications to save their state so often rather than just giving them a chance at the point the application is actually going to be terminated?

15. As described in Sec. 11.4, there is a special handle table used to allocate IDs for processes and threads. The algorithms for handle tables normally allocate the first available handle (maintaining the free list in LIFO order). In recent releases of Windows this was changed so that the ID table always keeps the free list in FIFO order. What is the problem that the LIFO ordering potentially causes for allocating process IDs, and
why does not UNIX have this problem?

16. Suppose that the quantum is set to 20 msec and the current thread, at priority 24, has just started a quantum. Suddenly an I/O operation completes and a priority 28 thread is made ready. About how long does it have to wait to get to run on the CPU?

17. In Windows, the current priority is always greater than or equal to the base priority. Are there any circumstances in which it would make sense to have the current priority be lower than the base priority? If so, give an example. If not, why not?

18. Windows uses a facility called Autoboost to temporarily raise the priority of a thread that holds the resource that is required by a higher-priority thread. How do you think this works?

19. In Windows it is easy to implement a facility where threads running in the kernel can temporarily attach to the address space of a different process. Why is this so much harder to implement in user mode? Why might it be interesting to do so?

20. Name two ways to give better response time to the threads in important processes.

21. Even when there is plenty of free memory available, and the memory manager does not need to trim working sets, the paging system can still frequently be writing to disk. Why?

22. Windows swaps the processes for modern applications rather than reducing their working set and paging them. Why would this be more efficient? (Hint: It makes much less of a difference when the disk is an SSD.)

23. Why does the self-map used to access the physical pages of the page directory and page tables for a process always occupy the same 8 MB of kernel virtual addresses (on the x86)?

24. The x86 can use either 64-bit or 32-bit page table entries. Windows uses 64-bit PTEs so the system can access more than 4 GB of memory. With 32-bit PTEs, the self-map uses only one PDE in the page directory, and thus occupies only 4 MB of addresses rather than 8 MB. Why is this?

25. If a region of virtual address space is reserved but not committed, do you think a VAD is created for it? Defend your answer.

26. Which of the transitions shown in Fig. 11-34 are policy decisions, as opposed to required moves forced by system events (e.g., a process exiting and freeing its pages)?

27. Suppose that a page is shared and in two working sets at once. If it is evicted from one of the working sets, where does it go in Fig. 11-34? What happens when it is evicted from the second working set?

28. When a process unmaps a clean stack page, it makes the transition (5) in Fig. 11-34. Where does a dirty stack page go when unmapped? Why is there no transition to the modified list when a dirty stack page is unmapped?

29. Suppose that a dispatcher object representing some type of exclusive lock (like a mutex) is marked to use a notification event instead of a synchronization event to announce that the lock has been released. Why would this be bad? How much would the answer depend on lock hold times, the length of quantum, and whether the system was a multiprocessor?

30. To support POSIX, the native NtCreateProcess API supports duplicating a process in order to support fork. In UNIX fork is shortly followed by an exec most of the time. One example where this was used historically was in the Berkeley dump(8S) program which would backup disks to magnetic tape. Fork was used as a way of checkpointing the dump program so it could be restarted if there was an error with the tape device. Give an example of how Windows might do something similar using NtCreateProcess. (Hint: Consider processes that host DLLs to implement functionality provided by a
third party).

31. A file has the following mapping. Give the MFT run entries.
    Offset 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
    Disk address 50 51 52 22 24 25 26 53 54 - 60

32. Consider the MFT record of Fig. 11-41. Suppose that the file grew and a 10th block was assigned to the end of the file. The number of this block is 66. What would the MFT record look like now?

33. In Fig. 11-44(b), the first two runs are each of length 8 blocks. Is it just an accident that they are equal, or does this have to do with the way compression works? Explain your answer.

34. Suppose that you wanted to build Windows Lite. Which of the fields of Fig. 11-45 could be removed without weakening the security of the system?

35. The mitigation strategy for improving security despite the continuing presence of vulnerabilities has been very successful. Modern attacks are very sophisticated, often requiring the presence of multiple vulnerabilities to build a reliable exploit. One of the vulnerabilities that is usually required is an information leak. Explain how an information leak can be used to defeat address-space randomization in order to launch an attack based on return-oriented programming.

36. An extension model used by many programs (Web browsers, Office, COM servers) involves hosting DLLs to hook and extend their underlying functionality. Is this a reasonable model for an RPC-based service to use as long as it is careful to impersonate clients before loading the DLL? Why not?

37. When running on a NUMA machine, whenever the Windows memory manager needs to allocate a physical page to handle a page fault it attempts to use a page from the NUMA node for the current threadâ€™s ideal processor. Why? What if the thread is currently running on a different processor?

38. Give a couple of examples where an application might be able to recover easily from a backup based on a volume shadow copy rather the state of the disk after a system crash.

39. In Sec. 11.10, providing new memory to the process heap was mentioned as one of the scenarios that require a supply of zeroed pages in order to satisfy security requirements. Give one or more other examples of virtual memory operations that require zeroed pages.

40. Windows contains a hypervisor which allows multiple operating systems to run simultaneously. This is available on clients, but is far more important in cloud computing. When a security update is applied to a guest operating system, it is not much different than patching a server. However, when a security update is applied to the root operating system, this can be a big problem for the users of cloud computing. What is the
nature of the problem? What can be done about it?

41. The regedit command can be used to export part or all of the registry to a text file under all current versions of Windows. Save the registry several times during a work session and see what changes. If you have access to a Windows computer on which you can install software or hardware, find out what changes when a program or device is added or removed.

42. Write a UNIX program that simulates writing an NTFS file with multiple streams. It should accept a list of one or more files as arguments and write an output file that contains one stream with the attributes of all arguments and additional streams with the contents of each of the arguments. Now write a second program for reporting on the attributes and streams and extracting all the components.
